<p>AxolotlKit is a free (as in Freedom) implementation of the Axolotl protocol, written in Objective-C.</p>

<p><img src="http://cl.ly/WYR4/68747470733a2f2f662e636c6f75642e6769746875622e636f6d2f6173736574732f373635392f323131353834382f36303637346365322d393035632d313165332d396233622d6634663830613766363533342e706e67.png" alt="AxolotlKit"></p>

<h3>
<a id="status" class="anchor" href="#status" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Status</h3>

<p>Axolotl is currently being reviewed. All scrutiny welcome. Once ready, it will be distributed via CocoaPods. </p>

<h2>
<a id="goal" class="anchor" href="#goal" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Goal</h2>

<p>AxolotlKit was designed to be a drop-in library that can be easily integrated into existing projects. </p>

<p>Axolotl is an <a href="https://github.com/trevp/axolotl/wiki">asynchronous cryptographic ratcheting protocol</a> <a href="https://github.com/WhisperSystems/TextSecure/wiki/ProtocolV2">with interesting properties</a>.</p>

<h2>
<a id="integration" class="anchor" href="#integration" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Integration</h2>

<p>AxolotlKit was designed with enough abstraction to integrate it easily into your own project. Please refer to the documentation or the TextSecure example to properly implement the required Objective-C storage protocols. </p>

<p>Unlike OTR, Axolotl is designed for long-lived sessions, keys need to be stored. AxolotlKit defines interfaces of the storage classes (<code>IdentityKeyStore.h</code>, <code>PreKeyStore.h</code>, <code>SessionStore.h</code> and <code>SignedPreKeyStore.h</code>). AxolotlKit objects do comply to <code>NSSecureCoding</code> so serialization of objects for the database is provided for you.</p>

<h3>
<a id="prekeys" class="anchor" href="#prekeys" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Prekeys</h3>

<p>A concept of <em>PreKeys</em> are used to achieve asynchronous perfect forward secrecy. PreKeys are composed of a Curve25519 public key and a unique ID, both stored by the server.</p>

<p>At install time, clients generate a single signed PreKey as well as a large list of unsigned PreKeys and transmit those to the server. </p>

<h3>
<a id="sessions" class="anchor" href="#sessions" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Sessions</h3>

<p>The Axolotl protocol is session-oriented.  Clients establish a "session," which is then used for all subsequent encrypt/decrypt operations.  There is no need to ever tear down a session once one has been established.</p>

<p>Sessions are established in one of these ways:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>PreKeyBundles. A client that wishes to send a message to a recipient can establish a session by retrieving a PreKeyBundle for that recipient from the server.</p></li>
<li><p>PreKeyWhisperMessages. A client can receive a PreKeyWhisperMessage from a recipient and use it to establish a session.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a id="state" class="anchor" href="#state" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>State</h3>

<p>An established session encapsulates a lot of state between two clients.  That state is maintained in durable records which need to be kept for the life of the session.</p>

<p>State is kept in the following places:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Identity State.  Clients will need to maintain the state of their own identity key pair, as well as identity public keys received from other clients.</p></li>
<li><p>PreKey State. Clients will need to maintain the state of their generated (private) PreKeys.</p></li>
<li><p>Signed PreKey States. Clients will need to maintain the state of the their signed (private) PreKeys.</p></li>
<li><p>Session State.  Clients will need to maintain the state of the sessions they have established.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>A: If Swift ends up being a good language for cryptographic applications, that will be considered. Itâ€™s still too early to make that call now. </p>
